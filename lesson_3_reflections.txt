1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   When there are multiple collaborators working on same program.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   It gives better control, prevents unnecessary push/pulls.
